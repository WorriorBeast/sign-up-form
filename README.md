# sign-up-form

This is a form to create an account for an imaginary service. The first, last name, and email are required to sign up.
The phone number section is up to the user whether or not they want to add their phone number to their account. The 
passwords much match each other to be able to submit the form.

This being my first form I really wanted to put to use of new knowledge of pseudo-classes, input states, and 
appropriate form controls with appropriate attributes. I wanted to include the pattern attribute in some of the 
inputs, but it's quite complex. There's quite a bit CSS I learned since completing my previous project, 
calculator. Using functions and viewport units to make the page responsive to the window size. Creating selectors 
targeting specific input states was quite interesting and challenging at first.

Checking if the passwords matched was an optional challenge. Thus far I've only learned about frontend for forms, 
not backend. Despite this I decided to do research on how I could send the passwords to Javascript. Found out 
it's not very different from sending a value from a button being clicked to Javascript. Preventing the form from 
being submitted was interesting to learn about.
